# undistortion
Some undistortion functions in Python, notably using the invertible "Dhane" function, i.e., the one discussed in the article:

Dhane, P., Kutty, K., & Bangadkar, S. (2012). A generic non-linear method for fisheye correction. International Journal of Computer Applications, 51(10). (invertible fisheye model)

The Python scripts also contain the (non-invertible) distortion function used in OpenCV for fisheye cameras.
